# Bacteria-Detection-SegNet
Satellite Imagery Analysis for Bacteria Detection in Water Bodies

Ths project was completed in fulfillment of my Machine Learning Project, submitted to Dr. Pankaj Agarwal.


1. Satellite Image Classification/Analysis is the most significant technique used in remote sensing for the computerized study and pattern recognition of satellite information.
2. It can help us to recognise various physical features like water, forest, agriculture and human caused calamities like forest fires, floods, etc.
3. It can also help prevent spread of diseases through factors like air, water, etc.

The main aim of this project is to monitor the amount of bacteria present and classify the different types of water bodies.
